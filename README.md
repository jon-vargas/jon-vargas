### :man_technologist: A little about me...

My name is Jonathan Vargas, I'm a Data Analyst with over 5 years of experience. A good portion of my work focuses on data quality and integration, for comparison, it's similar to that of an ETL Engineer. I have a fond interest of data science and analytics and created this GitHub to upload projects I've worked on. Currently trying to improve my knowledge in the realms of regressive techniques and machine learning. I particularly like Python and the vast amount of things you can do with it, so my uploaded projects may stray dependent on my interests. 

### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/CUFI9TxYuPjAH3m9Rs/giphy.gif" width="30"> Alrighty, enough of that work stuff... 

In my off time, I enjoy getting out and seeing live music and stand-up comedy or catching up with friends at a brewery. However, I do exhaust my social battery rather quick and am a huge homebody. I love relaxing at home and shutting off my brain to a good movie or playing video games. Anywho, that's me in a short summary, thanks for stopping by!
